Binary search is a search algorithm, which is used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array.
It is used by comparing the middle element to the target value. 
If they are equal, the position will be displayed. 
If they are not, the search will eliminate the half where the target value cannot lie, and start the search again in the remaining half.
This middle-element comparation will be repeated until the target value is found.
If the final remain part is empty, the value is not in the array.
This search algorithm is faster and more efficient than common search.
